[COLOR white]THANK YOU FOR ALL THE SUPPORT AND LOVE I'VE RECEIVED FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS![/COLOR]
[COLOR white]YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME![/COLOR]

[COLOR white]  It's been a great journey maintaining one of many favourites Kodi builds out there. I hope you guys have enjoyed Dominus, Sonar, Envision and Infusion 2 and by now are able to maintain and update the builds on your own and customize them the way you like them.[/COLOR]

[COLOR white]  I am really sorry to say goodbye but my time has come and I am leaving Kodi for good. I will be just like you right now sitting on the sofa and enjoying everything Kodi has to offer with my family.[/COLOR]

[COLOR white]  Thank you again for all the special moments, friends and everyone who helped me in the groups. Keep this community growing and stay safe.[/COLOR]

[COLOR white]Lots of love[/COLOR]
