    Version:
        2018-11-15:
            Updated for working with local files in addon path structure
            Path used in settings.xml for local is like below example:
                default="file://updates.txt" - When in Root Folder of addon
                default="file://xml/updates.xml" - When in XML folder of addon
            Putting the string $version$ in your file will cause the module to insert
                the version of the addon in that position
            Putting the string $changelog$ in your file will look for a changelog.txt in
                the top folder of your addon and insert it's contents in that position.

        2018-05-21:
            Updated to be self updating via settings.xml - NO Need To Change This File Anymore
            Takes into account if end-user API keys are stored in settings, and doesn't update it
                if they are.

        2018-05-19:
            Updated documentation in Header
            Added ability to disable service after updating API Keys (reduces load on Kodi startup)
            Removed old stuff


    Usage:
        Set this in your Jen v1.6 or higher and it should keep your end user's API Keys and Root XML
            in order automatically. Takes into account when user's have entered their own API keys
